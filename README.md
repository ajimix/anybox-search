# abs Anybox Search Client

**Super fast Anybox search for the terminal and Alfred.**

Allows to search Anybox bookmarks without the app running in both the terminal and in Alfred.

**Note:** This app uses Anybox database directly. This is undocumented and not supported by Anybox. So use it at your own risk!

**Terminal preview**
